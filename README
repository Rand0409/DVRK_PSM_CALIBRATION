DVRK website provided the stl file for 3d printing the constraints to hold the PSMs last 4 joints.

Howeverm, that dimension sometimes with 3D printer is not good.

So, as a fast and certain way to constrain the last 4 joints.

You can buy this bag of lego:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BB6BQW9M?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1

And format it as the picture shows.

Use a hot glue gun to make sure no moveing of the lego frame.
